Provider Block :
The provider "azurerm" block specifies that we are using the AzureRM provider to manage Azure resources.
The version attribute ensures compatibility by specifying the version of the provider.
The features {} block is required for some newer features in the AzureRM provider.
Resource Group :
The azurerm_resource_group resource defines a resource group in Azure.
The name attribute specifies the name of the resource group.
The location attribute specifies the region where the resource group will be created.
AKS Cluster :
The azurerm_kubernetes_cluster resource creates an AKS cluster.
The name attribute specifies the name of the AKS cluster, which must be unique within the resource group.
The resource_group_name links the AKS cluster to the previously defined resource group.
The location matches the location of the resource group.
The dns_prefix is used to generate the FQDN for the Kubernetes API server.
The default_node_pool block defines the default node pool for the cluster:
name: Name of the node pool.
node_count: Number of nodes in the node pool.
vm_size: Size of the virtual machines for the nodes.
The kubernetes_version specifies the version of Kubernetes to use in the cluster.
The identity block enables a system-assigned managed identity for the AKS cluster, which simplifies authentication and access management.
The tags attribute adds metadata to the resource for organizational purposes.
Outputs :
The output blocks provide useful information about the created AKS cluster:
aks_cluster_fqdn: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Kubernetes API server, which can be used to access the cluster.
aks_kube_config: The kubeconfig file content, which is necessary for connecting to the AKS cluster using tools like kubectl. This output is marked as sensitive to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.
